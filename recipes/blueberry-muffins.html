        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar, plus 1 tablespoon for muffin tops</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/3 cup neutral-flavored oil</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1/3 to 1/2 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>6 to 8 ounces fresh or frozen blueberries</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. For big-topped muffins, line 8 standard-size muffin cups with paper liners. For standard-size muffins line 10 muffin cups. Fill the remaining cups with 1 to 2 tablespoons of water to help the muffins bake evenly.</li>
            <li>Whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Add oil to a measuring jug that holds at least 1 cup. Add the egg then fill the jug to the 1-cup line with milk (1/3 to 1/2 cup milk). Add vanilla and whisk to combine.</li>
            <li>Add milk mixture to the bowl with dry ingredients then use a fork to combine. Do not over mix. Fold in the blueberries</li>
            <li>Divide the batter between muffin cups. (If making big-topped muffins, the batter will come to the tops of the paper liners). Sprinkle a little sugar on top of each muffin.</li>
            <li>Bake muffins 15 to 20 minutes or until tops are no longer wet and a toothpick inserted into the middle of a muffin comes out with crumbs, not wet batter. Transfer to a cooling rack.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Enjoy!</h4>
